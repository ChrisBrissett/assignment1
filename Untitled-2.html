<h3 class="h3" id="personal">Personal Information</h3>
<p class="paragraph">Welcome and thank you for taking the time to read my Profile. My name is Christopher Brissett although my friends call me ‘Polar’, do not ask. I am 31 and currently work as an Operations Manager for an Industrial Supplies company, I have been doing this for about 4 years and I really enjoy the challenges the role gives me daily. The challenges which come with integrating and updating our current IT infrastructure have pushed me to pursue a career in IT, as I have always been fascinated by the intricate details that go with developing and managing such systems.<br><br>
However, it is not all work no play for me. I am an avid gamer and I like to spend countless hours playing Xbox or PC whenever I can spare the time. I have what many may call an ‘Obsession’ with Formula 1, it doesn’t matter what time of the morning the race is on, you will find me sitting there glued to the TV watching every lap without fail. <br><br>
Apart from most of my time being taken up with my work and hobby’s, I also like to use some dutch courage and get up on stage in front of people at open mic comedy nights and talk absolute garbage for 10mins, I love being able to tell a joke and hopefully get a laugh.
</p>
	<h3 class="h3" id="interest">Interest in IT</h3>
	<p class="paragraph">I have had a profound interest in IT for as long as I can remember. If I were to pick a moment where my interest began it would be as a young boy when I played a game, my father had designed using Java. It was a simple 2D game which was challenging to complete. What really grabbed my interest was that it was something I could enjoy to the level I did, could be designed by some code, I spent hours playing this game and have always wanted to be able to develop something similar for others to enjoy like I did. <br><br>
I have decided to come to RMIT through OUA to get myself a Bachelor of Information Technology. The flexibility to be able to learn and complete this degree from home and around my other commitments was the major factor for choosing to Enroll in the degree. After looking into what I wanted to get out of a higher education in the field of IT, I chose RMIT as I believe it will give me the skills and education needed to progress into my desired industry of work once I have completed my degree. This would be working on game development with the use of C++ programming. <br><br>
Whilst now I do not have the greatest of knowledge around IT systems and technologies, I am of the strong belief at RMIT I will be able to acquire these skills and education. This being in direct correlation to being able to develop, install & maintain computer systems and software’s.  In addition to that also working through to gain a more detailed education in IT systems and Internet Design. 
</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ideal">Ideal Job</h3>
<p class="paragraph">
	<a href="https://codemasters.csod.com/ux/ats/careersite/2/home/requisition/223?c=codemasters"><img src="Pictures/F1.png" alt="" width="766" height="455" id="imgf1"/></a><br>
	My ideal job once completing all relevant education and gaining all the required skills would be a Game Programmer with Codemasters. The position is one in which I would be working within a team environment to develop new releases of the Formula 1 title released by Codemasters. This would entail using the C++ Programming language along with the unique game engine developed by Codemasters. What makes this position so appealing to me is that I have a great interest in Formula 1, along with deep knowledge of the intricacies of Formula 1. Combining this with my interest in playing video games and in particular the Formula 1 title.<br><br>
To be able to work in this position I would need to gain knowledge of the C++ programming language and have experience in writing other programs and games, to be able to effectively gain these skills I would also need a higher education in programming & game development. To date I do not have any of the skills required for the position, apart from a passion of both Formula 1 & video games.<br><br>
To gain the skills required to gain the position I would need to follow the below plan as closely as possible.
First, I would need to start a higher education looking to acquire a relevant degree, this would be a Bachelor of Information Technology. When completing the degree, I would need to work on certain electives which would give me the base knowledge to jump into a career of game development and programming once I have graduated. When in the later stages of obtaining the degree, I would look to complete electives such as ‘Further Programming’ & ‘Object-Orientated Programming in C++’.
Once I have done this, I would then be able to gain work in a similar role to the ideal one I am after by working on other game development and projects which involve using C++ as the coding language. I would need to work in this field for a few years until I have gained a comprehensive knowledge of using C++ to create object-orientated programs.

  <img src="Pictures/MBTI-2.png" alt="" width="300" height="350" id="img1"/>The results of the above tests have provided me with some insight into specific learning styles and how it is determined I may interact with others. Whilst I do not feel as the results can be used to fully portray how I view myself or my interactions, they can be used a basis to understand in more depth certain mannerisms I might display. If I was to look into more depth the results and draw a conclusion based on them all, I would tend to slightly agree that overall my approach to any interaction, group work or task is considered methodical and thoroughly planed out ahead. Also, being able to display strong communication skills with others I might work with. <br><br>

In a team environment it will most likely cause me to have a different approach as opposed to if I had not taken the tests. Some ways this might be brought forward would be that I would be more conscious of how I might come across to other members in the group, especially if they have a certain personality which might be more susceptible to noticing different mannerisms. This for example might be the INFJ strength of being decisive,<img src="Pictures/Learning-Styles-1.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" id="img3"/> determined, and passionate about ideas or tasks to be accomplished. Whereas other personality types might have a more relaxed approach to reaching a conclusion to the task. This therefore would make me aware of how my actions may come across. A linking characteristic this would be how I could burn out too easily by approaching a task at full steam. The results of the tests have certainly opened my eyes into what I can look for in myself and others in the team.
<br><br>
<img src="Pictures/DISC.png" alt="" width="260" height="240" class="img4"/>When forming a team based on the results of the members that will be in the group, it would a wise move to consider how the styles and personalities can match up and interact cohesively with each other. The idiom ‘Too many chiefs, not enough Indians’ as an example, should certainly be a consideration when forming a team. Having too many people in a team environment that would wish to be the ‘Leader’ could cause conflict and distraction among the group. So, when looking at the results you would certainly want to make sure that a balance is created. By doing this, it would also be able to gain input of different ideas and perspectives from a diverse range of rationales and viewpoints. </p>

	<h3 class="h3" id="project">Project Idea</h3>
	<h4 class="h4">Overview</h4>
<p class="paragraph">The Project I would like to undertake and implement would be to design an app for use on the Google play and Apple store’s, which would replace the score sheets and cards for when playing the board game Cluedo. The game will be downloadable and useable to keep track of each game you play, making it a more effective method of being able to keep track of what cards you were dealt along with being able to make off options you have ruled out in the current game. The app will also randomly be able to select the cards which the players will need to guess to win the game along with randomly allocated what is leave evenly amongst all players.</p>
	<h4 class="h4">Motivation</h4>
	<p class="paragraph">The motivation behind this idea, is myself being one of the many people worldwide who still enjoy the social experience of playing board games with family and friends, I find that constantly pieces of the game go missing but most significantly for the game of Cluedo is having to re-print pages upon pages of scoresheets to replace the once that are already all scribbled over. Whilst it is true that most board games can be played on some sort of gaming platform nowadays, trying to combine the accessibility to of mobile phones and the social togetherness of playing board games is the driving motivation behind this idea.</p>
	<h4 class="h4">Description</h4>
	<p class="paragraph">The Application would be designed to require people to log onto their relevant app store and download the app. Upon opening the app players will be able to create or join a lobby which will allow others playing the same game to join and register them as apart of the current game, the person who creates the lobby will be allocated as the game host. The app will have the functionality to pre-allocate the cards that the players are required to guess to win the game.<br> <br>
Once this is done the game ‘Host’ will be choose a function on the app which will shuffle and deal the remaining cards to the number of players in the game, as would happen in any standard game of Cluedo. The app will be able to show a graphical image of the cards on the screen, personal to each player. What this will achieve is that as the game progresses each person using their own app will be able to minimize their cards and refer to them at any time, this would also be relevant when having to show another player a card of yours. Players will be able to select a card and in ‘Show’ mode, which is a mode specifically designed when requiring to show a card, they will be able to present their phone to another player, once the screen has been touched the card will appear face up for 3 seconds, allowing the other person to mark it on their scoresheet. <br><br>
The scoresheet being the other operational part of the app designed to make the game easier to play, will allow the user to check boxes as per the cards they have but also ones that have seen by another player. There will also be a shading system for the scoresheet as well which would allow you mark off the guesses being made by other players. For anyone who has ever played Cluedo before would know the benefits for being able to reach a conclusion based on what is being guessed more often.  The benefits of using the app especially for this part of the game will remove the ‘cubby houses’ of boxes people build so no one can see what they have written down.<br><br>
As mentioned previously obviously there are already electronic versions of this game available on various platforms, with the app and its design the group of people playing will be able to choose at what level of interaction with the game would be required from the app. That being, choosing whether to only use the scoresheet or using the cards as well, all dependent on player preference. The app is not designed to take over the interaction in place between people playing but to allow a more streamline experience and decrease the chances of a table being flipped over in the living room. 
</p>
	<h4 class="h4">Tools and Technoolgies</h4>
	<p class="paragraph">The tools and technologies required to implement this idea would be the use of PhoneGap by Adobe. The reasoning behind using this is that PhoneGap is a cross-platform developer for mobile apps. Other technologies to consider using would be Java for designing the app for Android operating systems or Objective-C for the Apple store.
Along with the above, we would need a cloud server to store the information in the app and allowing players to be able to connect to the same lobby.
</p>
	<h4 class="h4">Skills Required</h4>
	<p class="paragraph">To be able to write and develop the proposed app we would need to have the skill in the above app development tools, along with the knowledge of how Object-Orientated programming functionality works to be able to develop the code needed to create the basis for the app to function. 
Luckily, for this app to be developed, the hardware is already in place as mobile phones and being able download apps from the app store is already easily accessible. The main challenge being faced with developing the app is gaining a comprehensive knowledge of the development tools listed above.
</p>
	<h4 class="h4">Outcome</h4>
	<p class="paragraph">Overall, I believe this project to be one that could be quite achievable.  If we were to successfully develop the app the main issue the app is designed to alleviate will be achieved. This would remove the paper scoresheet requirement from the game. Whilst the app is giving users access to a digital version of the scoresheet and cards, it will not remove the social interaction surrounding playing the game. This will solve the original problem of running out the paper scoresheets, as well as any lost or misplaced pieces of the game. </p>
